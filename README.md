### Life of P.I

Life of Pi by Yann Martel is the story of Pi Patel, a young Indian boy who survives a shipwreck and is stranded on a lifeboat in the Pacific Ocean with a Bengal tiger named Richard Parker. Over the course of 227 days, Pi struggles to survive, relying on his resourcefulness, faith, and the bond he forms with the tiger. The novel explores themes of faith, survival, and the power of storytelling, with Pi reflecting on his belief in God and the mysteries of the universe.

The story concludes with Pi offering two versions of his survival tale to authorities—one with a tiger and one without—and leaving the choice up to the listener. The novel’s underlying motto is:

## "The world is an insanely beautiful place, and it is up to us to decide how to interpret it.
